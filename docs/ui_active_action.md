# Active Actions — from `ui_review.md`

Action plan derived from [`ui_review.md`](ui_review.md). Item numbers
(`UR #N`) reference that document, which now lists only the open items
(completed items were removed from it; item numbers keep the original
numbering).

## Queued (from `ui_review.md`)

### High

| # | Action | Source | Notes / dependencies |
|---|--------|--------|----------------------|
| H2 | **JSON validation (to analyze)** for `output_schema`, `configuration`, context `content` (`QJsonDocument::fromJson`, clear "invalid JSON" message; at minimum a "Validate JSON" button) | UR #15 | analyze first: not all three fields are necessarily JSON — `configuration` is backend-specific JSON (`DBDesign.md`), `output_schema` is a JSON schema, but context `content` may be plain text; decide scope before implementing (dialogs + context panel editor) |

## Summary

- **Now:** H2 (JSON validation, to analyze) — the only queued action.
- After shipping each item: drop it from the open lists and the Summary
  (the commit is the record).
